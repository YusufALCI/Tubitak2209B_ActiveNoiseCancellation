# Tubitak2209B_ActiveNoiseCancellation
This repository created for Active Noise Cancellation project that our Tubitak 2209 B project. In this project we use STM32 and mems microphone and speaker. We processing voice digital signal (DSP)  We distinguish noise and non noise voice using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then we suppress the noise using the destructive interference method
